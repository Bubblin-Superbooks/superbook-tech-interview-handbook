You should be familiar with the various tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order algorithms and graph traversal algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first search. In my experience, using more advanced graph algorithms (Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall) is quite rare and usually not necessary.)</p><ul><li>Validate Binary Search Tree</li><li>Invert/Flip Binary Tree</li><li>Non-overlapping Intervals</li><li>Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree</li></ul></div> </div>
