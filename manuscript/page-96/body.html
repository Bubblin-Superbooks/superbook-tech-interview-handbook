| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Prepare pen, paper and earphones/headphones. |
| ✅ | Find a quiet environment with good Internet connection. |
| ✅ | Ensure webcam and audio are working. There were times I had to restart Chrome to get Hangouts to work again. |
| ✅ | Request for the option to interview over Hangouts/Skype instead of a phone call; it is easier to send links or text across. |
| ✅ | Decide on and be familiar with a programming language. |
| ✅ | Familiarize yourself with the coding environment (CoderPad/CodePen). Set up the coding shortcuts, turn on autocompletion, tab spacing, etc. |
