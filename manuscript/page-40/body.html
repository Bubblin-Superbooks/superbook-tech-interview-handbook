You will be asked to speak with an interviewer either over a phone call or VoIP (Skype/Hangout). A question will be given to you and you will work on that question using an online collaborative editor (CoderPad/CodePen/Google Docs).</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">You are usually not allowed to execute the code even if the editor supports execution.
