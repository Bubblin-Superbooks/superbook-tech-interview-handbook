For example, a hash map can be used together with a doubly-linked list to achieve O(1 time complexity for both the <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> operation in an <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/">LRU cache</a>.)</p><p>Hashmaps are probably the most commonly used data structure for algorithm questions. If you are stuck on a question, your last resort can be to enumerate through the common possible data structures (thankfully there aren't that many of them and consider whether each of them can be applied to the problem. This has worked for me sometimes.)</p></div> </div>
