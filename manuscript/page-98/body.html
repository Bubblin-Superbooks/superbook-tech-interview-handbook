| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Repeat the question back at the interviewer. |
| ✅ | Clarify any assumptions you made subconsciously. Many questions are under-specified on purpose. A tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution would not work. |
| ✅ | Clarify input format and range. Ask whether input can be assumed to be well-formed and non-null. |
| ✅ | Work through a small example to ensure you understood the question. |
| ✅ | Explain a high level approach even if it is a brute force one. |
| ✅ | Improve upon the approach and optimize. Reduce duplicated work and cache repeated computations. |
| ✅ | Think carefully, then state and explain the time and space complexity of your approaches. |
| ✅ | If stuck, think about related</p></div> </div>
