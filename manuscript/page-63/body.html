<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">C++. I would absolutely avoid lower level languages like C or Go, simply because they lack many standard library functions and data structures and some may require manual memory management.</p><p>Personally, Python is my de facto choice for algorithm coding interviews because it is succinct and has a pretty huge library of functions and data structures available. One of my top reasons for recommending Python is that it uses consistent APIs that operate on different data structures, such as <code>len()</code>, <code>for ... in ...</code> and slicing notation on sequences (strings/lists/tuples). Getting the last element in a sequence is <code>arr[-1]</code> and reversing it is simply <code>arr[::-1]</code>. You can achieve a lot with minimal syntax in Python.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Java is a decent choice too but having to constantly declare types in your code means extra keystrokes which results in slower coding/typing speed. This issue will be more apparent when you have to write on a whiteboard</p></div> </div>
