<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h6>Be Clear About Your Objectives</h6><p>Are you looking for a summer internship/full-time employment? What position are you applying for? Read the job description and know the job you are applying for!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><strong>"Work experience" does not mean any work experience; it means <em>relevant</em> work experience.</strong> If you are applying for a developer position, the recruiter is not interested to know that you were a student escort for girls walking back to their apartments at night, nor that you were a cashier at Starbucks. You would be better off writing about the project you did for some programming class - yes, even if it was just a school project. Tailor your experiences and projects according to the job you are applying for. Pick relevant details to emphasize on and do not be hesitant to drop stuff completely if they are totally irrelevant.
