<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><ul><li class="split-li ">maximizes the number of days of occupancy, at the same time, leaving at least a 1-day gap in-between bookings for cleaning.

The problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of non-consecutive array elements.

E.g.
// [5, 1, 1, 5] => 10
The above array would represent an example booking period as follows -
// Dec 1 - 5
// Dec 5 - 6
// Dec 6 - 7
// Dec 7 - 12

The answer would be to pick Dec 1-5 (5 days and then pick Dec 7-12 for a total of 10 days of)

Similarly,

// [4, 10, 3, 1, 5] => 15</li><li>The problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of non-consecutive array elements.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">E.g.
