Also find out the underlying sorting algorithm that is being used in the language's <code>sort()</code> function and its time and space complexity (in Python its Timsort which is a hybrid sort). After completing a question on LeetCode, I usually add the time and space complexities of the written code as comments above the function body to remind myself to analyze the algorithm after I am done with the implementation.)</p><h6>Practice Good Coding Style</h6><p>Read up on the recommended coding style for your language and stick to it. If you have chosen Python, refer to the PEP 8 Style Guide. If you have chosen Java, refer to Google's Java Style Guide.</p><h6>Internalize The Pitfalls</h6><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Find out and be familiar with the common pitfalls</p></div> </div>
