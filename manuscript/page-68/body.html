<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">implemented, check out <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/yangshun/lago">Lago</a>, a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that is able to be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.</p><h5>Mastery Through Practice</h5><p>Next, gain familiarity and mastery of the algorithms and data structures in your chosen programming language.</p><h6>Practice Coding Questions</h6><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Practice coding algorithms using your chosen language. While <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> is a good resource for practice, I prefer being able to type code, run it and get instant feedback. There are various Online Judges such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a> for you to practice questions online and get used to the language. From experience, LeetCode</p></div> </div>
