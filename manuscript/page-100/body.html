| ✅ | Ask for permission to use trivial functions without having to implement them; saves you some time. |
| ✅ | Use the hints given by the interviewer. |
| ✅ | Demonstrate mastery of your chosen programming language. |
| ✅ | Demonstrate technical knowledge in data structures and algorithms. |
| ✅ | If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting (no time constraints). E.g., I would write a regex to parse this string rather than using <code>split()</code> which may not cover all cases. |
| ✅ | Practice whiteboard space-management skills. |
| ⚠️ | Reasonable defensive coding. Check for nulls, empty collections, etc. Can omit if input validity has been clarified with the interviewer. |
| ❌ | Remain quiet the whole time. |
| ❌ | Spend too much time writing comments. |
| ❌ | Use extremely verbose variable names. |
| ❌ | Copy and paste code without checking.</p></div> </div>
