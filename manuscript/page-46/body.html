This session involves writing code on your own laptop to solve 3 well-defined algorithm problems in around 45 minutes after which an engineer will come in and review the code with you. You are not supposed to run the code while working on the problem</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Tips:
No front end questions were asked
Asana places high emphasis on System Design and makes heavy use of the whiteboard. You do not necessarily have to write code for the algorithm question of the first three interviews
All 4 sessions involve algorithms and system design. One of the sessions will be conducted by an Engineering Manager
The last session will involve coding on your own laptop. Prepare your development environment in advance
Regardless of Product Engineer or Engineering</li></ul></div> </div>
