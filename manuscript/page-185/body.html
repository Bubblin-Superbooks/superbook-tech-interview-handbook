Hence it is important that you be familiar with traversing a 2-D matrix. When recursively traversing the matrix, always ensure that your next position is within the boundary of the matrix.

A simple template for doing depth-first searches on a matrix goes like this:</p><pre class="  "><code>def traverse(matrix):
