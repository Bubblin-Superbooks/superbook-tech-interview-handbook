| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Scan through your code for mistakes as if it was your first time seeing code written by someone else. |
| ✅ | Check for off-by-one errors. |
| ✅ | Come up with more test cases. Try extreme test cases. |
| ✅ | Step through your code with those test cases. |
| ✅ | Look out for places where you can refactor. |
| ✅ | Reiterate the time and space complexity of your code. |
| ✅ | Explain trade-offs and how the code/approach can be improved if given more time. |
| ❌ | Immediately announce that you are done coding. Do the above first! |
| ❌ | Argue with the interviewer. They may be wrong but that is very unlikely given that they are familiar with the question. |</p><h6>Wrap Up</h6></div> </div>
