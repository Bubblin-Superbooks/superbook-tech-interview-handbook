Given 2 interval ranges, create a function to tell me if these ranges intersect. Both start and end are inclusive: [start, end]
E.g. [1, 4] and [5, 6] => false
E.g. [1, 4] and [3, 6] => true


Given 2 interval ranges that intersect, now create a function to merge the 2 ranges into a single continuous range.
E.g. [1, 4] and [3, 6] => [1, 6]


Now create a function that takes a group of unsorted, unorganized</li></ul></div> </div>
