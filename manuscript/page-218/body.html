Questions involving matrices are usually related to dynamic programming or graph traversal.</p><p>For questions involving traversal or dynamic programming, you almost always want to make a copy of the matrix with the same dimensions that is initialized to empty values to store the visited state or dynamic programming table. Be familiar with such a routine:</p><pre><code>rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
copy = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]</code></pre></div> </div>
