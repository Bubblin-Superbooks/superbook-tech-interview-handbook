Help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Why do I want this?

This repository has _practical_ content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.

## Who is this for?

Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.

## How is this repository different?

There are many awesome books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top quality curated content directly for your consumption.

Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. üòé

## Looking for Front End content?

Front end-related content have been extracted out into a separate repository - [Front End Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook).

## Contents

A [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) website has been created to provide a better reading experience. Check out the website [here](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/)!

## Related

If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out [Lago](https://github.com/yangshun/lago), a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that is able to be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Contributing

There are no formal contributing guidelines at the moment as things are still in flux and we might find a better approach to structure content as we go along. You are welcome to contribute whatever you think will be helpful to fellow engineers. If you would like to contribute content for different domains, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request and we can discuss further.

### THE MANUSCRIPT, ala this repo.

The manuscript on this repo has been generated programmatically using [Bookiza Abelone](https://bookiza.io), [h2s](https://github.com/bookiza/h2s) and a few other sanitization libraries.


:point_right: As part of the vocabulary of publishing with Bookiza, this git repo is the `manuscript` whereas the &apos;consumer-ready&apos; distributable form i.e. `book` is hosted _live_ on the url at the top.


### GOING FULLSCREEN

To be able to read the book in [fullscreen mode](https://bubblin.io/blog/fullscreen-api-ipad), please try the following steps:

- Open the book on iOS (&gt; 12.00) Safari
- Tap the `...` button at bottom right of the screen to open Superbook controls.
- Tap `&#x292E;` on the top right (middle button) to go fullscreen.

iPadOS Safari v12.0 and above only.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions are super welcome.

1. If you are good at spotting typographical errors, detect (and fix) the widows &amp; orphans and understand how line-tracking works for texts, go ahead submit your PR.

2. This book may contain older illustrations. Feel free to replace those with new art of your own. All approved art will be reciprocated with credit (link) on the book to the artist.

## HACKING, FIXES AND TRANSLATIONS
