### THE MANUSCRIPT, ala this repo.

The manuscript on this repo has been generated programmatically using [Bookiza Abelone](https://bookiza.io), [h2s](https://github.com/bookiza/h2s) and a few other sanitization libraries.


:point_right: As part of the vocabulary of publishing with Bookiza, this git repo is the `manuscript` whereas the &apos;consumer-ready&apos; distributable form i.e. `book` is hosted _live_ on the url at the top.


### GOING FULLSCREEN

To be able to read the book in [fullscreen mode](https://bubblin.io/blog/fullscreen-api-ipad), please try the following steps:

- Open the book on iOS (&gt; 12.00) Safari
- Tap the `...` button at bottom right of the screen to open Superbook controls.
- Tap `&#x292E;` on the top right (middle button) to go fullscreen.

iPadOS Safari v12.0 and above only.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions are super welcome.

1. If you are good at spotting typographical errors, detect (and fix) the widows &amp; orphans and understand how line-tracking works for texts, go ahead submit your PR.

2. This book may contain older illustrations. Feel free to replace those with new art of your own. All approved art will be reciprocated with credit (link) on the book to the artist.

## HACKING, FIXES AND TRANSLATIONS


#### A. HACK THE BOOK

To mint your own edition of say `Pride &amp; Prejudice` (you can re-typeset, add new art or illustrations or translate to another language), follow the below given steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own Github Account,
2. Clone the forked project to your local,
3. Install [Bookiza](https://bookiza.io) globally. This requires node and npm,
