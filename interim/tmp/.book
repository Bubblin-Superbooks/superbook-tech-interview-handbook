Landscape differences due to geographical location are mentioned briefly .</p><h5>Career Prospects As A Software Engineer</h5><h6>High Demand</h6><p>Almost every domain leverages on technology, hence Software Engineers are needed in almost every industry. Demand for engineers is higher than supply, leading to generally high-paying jobs. Moreover, the demand is continuously growing.</p><h6>Stable Career</h6>",
  "page-12": "<p>Computer Science is rapidly gaining popularity and engineering is a highly-regarded professional career. Unlike the creative industry, you do not have to be the top 1% of the industry to lead a comfortable life. An engineer fresh out of college working at a Silicon Valley company (both large companies and startups can expect to receive a starting salary of more than USD 100,000 and it just gets better from there.)</p><h6>Require Lifelong Learning</h6><p>Technology industry is an extremely fast-moving one. Many technologies used today didn't even exist/were popular a decade ago; in 2009, mobile app development and blockchain were pretty much unheard of. Engineers constantly need to upgrade their skills to stay relevant to the demands of the job market. Engineering is a great career for passionate individuals who like to learn.</p>",
  "page-13": "<h6>Flexible</h6><p>A software engineering job is perhaps the most flexible job that exists in terms of hours, location and environment. Physical location is usually not an issue and there are many tech companies that are fully remote. There's no formal attire to be worn and working hours are generally flexible. Your co-workers would stare at you weirdly if you came to work wearing a shirt and tie.</p><h5>Internships Vs Full-time</h5><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If you dream of working at a top-tier tech company one day, getting hired via an intern conversion is by far the easiest way to achieve that. Internship interviews are extremely short (usually just 2 rounds whereas interviews for full-time roles are usually 4-5 rounds). Internships allow you to work at a company over a short period of time (3 months or so and helps in</p>",

In the earlier stages where product-market fit hasn't been found, companies would be rapidly iterating on products and features, whereas larger companies that have already found the right product will focus on scaling their infrastructure and growing their users. Liquid compensation is also lower at early-stage companies due to the equity not being worth any money, but there is the chance of earning a lot more if/when the company IPOs or gets acquired.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">|  | Early-stage Startup | Late-stage Startup | Large Company |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Company Size | <100 | 100-1000 | >1000 |\n| Compensation | Base salary is a bit higher than big companies.

You can follow her on [Medium](<a href=\"https://medium.com/@christinang89\">https://medium.com/@christinang89</a> or <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Christina-Ng\">Quora</a>.)</p><h5>How Your Resume Is Screened</h5><p>While many engineers can be rather qualified for the role they are applying for, they miss out on getting a shot at the interview as they might never get past resume screening. The main issue was that they do not understand how recruiters worked.</p>",
  "page-19": "<p>Before writing your resume, it is important to understand the recruiting structure and how recruiting is done.</p><h6>The Skill Set Checklist</h6><p>Before opening up a position/starting the search for candidates, I usually consult very closely with the team manager/decision maker to find out the specific skill sets that are relevant for the position. These skill sets are typically grouped into \"Must have\", \"Good to have\", and \"Special bonus\".</p><ul><li>\"Must have\" — Typically, most of the must-haves include a degree (or not in a relevant technical field, some years (or not) of experience in a particular programming language or technology.)</li><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">\"Good to have\" — Includes experience/familiarity with secondary languages/technologies which may not be directly relevant to what the candidate would</li></ul>",
  "page-20": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">be working on, but could be required due to some interfacing with other components of the project. It could also include softer skills such as being a good team player, clear communication, etc.</li><li>\"Special bonus\" — Recognized skill sets/experiences which are difficult to come by. Probably not a requirement, but would definitely be useful for the position.</li></ul><p>Now that I am armed with this list, the search for candidates begin.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Typically, I do not seek that \"one perfect candidate\". What I seek for is the \"best fit candidate\". The search is essentially a numbers game. I know that for a specific job posting, there would perhaps be X applicants. At each stage of the interview process, some percentage of the candidates will be eliminated, leaving only a final Y% of the initial pool to choose from. Since Y tends to be a rather small number, recruiters will try to maximize</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">X.</p><h6>The 10 Seconds Glance</h6><p>When I am looking at your resume, I am doing a keyword match against the skill set checklist. If I see a good amount of the right keywords in your resume, it is a pass. If I need to spend more than 10 seconds trying to figure out what you are writing about, it is a fail. If I see an excessive amount of keywords (much looking like spam), it signals a red flag and goes into the \"maybe\". Depending on whether I think I have enough candidates for the day, you could eventually go into the pass or fail stack.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There are lots of articles writing about how recruiters only spend an average of about 10 seconds to screen each resume. The news is, this is true because resume screening is such a menial, robotic and repetitive task. In fact, many applicant tracking systems (ATS now</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">are so advanced that they can parse your resume automatically, search for specific keywords in your resume, and score your resume based on the weights pre-assigned to each keyword.)</p><p>Finding a job is a two-way fit — the company wants someone with the relevant skills required, but it is also important for the applicant to fit in the company culture, and be able to gain something out of their stint. Hence, honesty is the single most important criteria in a resume.</p><p>There is a delicate balance between finding the right job vs. finding a job. Getting rejected does not always mean you are not good enough. Sometimes, it just means you are not a right fit for what the company is looking for.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When hiring fresh grads, I know that many of them will not have as much experience as someone who has years of industry experience. Hence, I would look out</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">more for soft skills, such as attention to detail, initiative, passion, ability to get things done, etc. Note: this applies only if you have met the minimum threshold of proficiency/competency in the skill set checklist.</p><h5>10 Ways To Improve Your Resume</h5><p>Now that you are aware of how recruiters screen your resume, here are 10 actionable ways you can do to improve your resume.</p><h6>Cover Letter</h6><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I've often received resumes with no cover letters, and I am perfectly fine with it. If you ask me, it is better to have no cover letter than to have a bad cover letter, especially if your cover letter is a \"templated\" content. An effective cover letter needs to highlight the fit between the job requirements and your skills/experiences. Do not just tell me what you have done in your cover letter; Tell me how it is a fit for what</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">I am looking for.</p><p>Some small nitpicks:</p><ul><li>Make sure that the cover letter is addressed to the right person (either the name of the recruiter if it is known, or to a generic hiring manager and company.)</li><li>Run a spell check.</li></ul><h6>Length Of Resume</h6><p>Your resume should be kept to 1 page or a MAXIMUM of 2 pages. Include only your most recent and relevant experiences.</p><p>Information that a recruiter wants to know:</p><ul><li>Name, email, contact number.</li><li>Education details: College, Major, GPA, Sample classes (optional, but if you list, make sure its classes that you scored well in and are relevant to your area of interest), academic awards, availability.</li></ul>",
  "page-25": "<ul><li>If you have studied abroad, you can list that too.</li><li>Projects that you have worked on.</li><li>Work experience/co-curricular activities.</li><li>Skills/other interests.</li><li>Street cred - GitHub/Stack Overflow/LinkedIn profile (optional, but highly recommended).</li></ul><p>Information nobody needs to know:</p><ul><li>Your profile picture. In the US, it is illegal to discriminate based on age, gender, race, or appearance.</li><li>Address, home phone number, gender, religion, race, marital status, etc etc.</li><li>Elementary, middle, high school.</li><li>Your low GPA.</li><li>Anything less recent than 3-4 years unless they are valid job experiences.</li><li>Anything about your parents/siblings, their names, occupation, etc.</li></ul>",
  "page-26": "<ul><li>Your life story.</li><li>Anything not relevant to the job you are applying for (e.g. that you have a driving license when you are applying to be a programmer).</li></ul><p>Ideally, keep it short, concise, but as detailed as possible.</p><h6>Gpa Does Matter</h6><p>Everyone wants the cream of the crop. In the absence of a standardized test, GPA serves as that indicator. <strong>While GPA may not necessarily be a good indication of how well you can code, a high GPA would definitely put you in a more favorable position to the recruiter.</strong></p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If your GPA is rather low, but you have loads of technical experiences, you can try not listing your GPA in the resume. This kinda \"forces\" the recruiter to read through your projects/job experience, and perhaps</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">grant you a first interview. If you manage to impress them, who cares about your GPA? But if your GPA is low and you do not have skills for the job... maybe you should work on one of them and revisit job applications later.</p><p>In a different scenario, some students have low GPA, but it might be due to some irrelevant classes which they did badly in. E.g. Student X is scoring A for all his programming classes, but did not do well for his language classes. If I am hiring a developer, Student X would still be a suitable candidate despite his low GPA. In such cases, it might even be recommended to attach a transcript along with the resume.</p><p>Also, when you list your GPA/results, try to benchmark it. Instead of simply listing 4.6, write 4.6/5.0 (First Class Honors or Summa Cum Laude). To the recruiter, 4.6 does not mean anything if he/she is not familiar with your grading system.</p>",
  "page-28": "<h6>Be Clear About Your Objectives</h6><p>Are you looking for a summer internship/full-time employment? What position are you applying for? Read the job description and know the job you are applying for!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \"><strong>\"Work experience\" does not mean any work experience; it means <em>relevant</em> work experience.</strong> If you are applying for a developer position, the recruiter is not interested to know that you were a student escort for girls walking back to their apartments at night, nor that you were a cashier at Starbucks. You would be better off writing about the project you did for some programming class - yes, even if it was just a school project. Tailor your experiences and projects according to the job you are applying for. Pick relevant details to emphasize on and do not be hesitant to drop stuff completely if they are totally irrelevant. Quality over</p>",
  "page-29": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">quantity.</p><ul><li>Make sure the description is comprehensive. Avoid writing \"Software engineering intern - write code\". You are better off not writing anything.</li><li>Based on my experience, most fresh grads do not have extremely relevant job experience (unless you are lucky to have scored a really rewarding internship). For developer positions, I think it is ok to not have any job experience and just list projects.</li></ul><h6>Reverse Chronological Order</h6><p>Always list your resume in reverse chronological order - the most recent at the top. Recruiters are more interested in what you have worked on recently than what you worked on 3 years ago. Chances are, you probably forgot the details too anyway.</p><h6>Make Sure You Are Contactable</h6><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">Get a proper email account with ideally your first</li></ul>",
  "page-30": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">name and last name, eg. \"john.doe@gmail.com\" instead of \"angrybirds88@gmail.com\".</li><li>If you are using your school's .edu email, try to have an alias like \"john.doe@xxx.edu\" instead of \"a002342342@xxx.edu\".</li><li>Avoid emails like \"me@christi.na\" or \"admin@[mycooldomain].com\" -- because it is very prone to typo errors.</li><li>Make sure the number you have listed is the best way to reach you. The last thing you want is to miss the call from the recruiter because you typed the wrong number, or you are not available on that number during office hours (most probably the times the recruiter will call).</li></ul><h6>Layout/formatting/design</h6><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">Be consistent about the way you format your resume. Italics, underline, bold, and how they are</li></ul>",
  "page-31": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">used.</li><li>Keep to a single standard font (avoid fancy fonts like Comic Sans or whatever and do not have too many varying styles/font sizes/color)</li><li>Be consistent about the way you list your dates (eg. May 2011 - Aug 2011). Avoid using numerals for both month and date due to the difference in style for MMDD and DDMM in different countries. Dates like \"Aug 2011 - June 12\" just show that you have zero attention to detail.</li><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">Unless you are applying for a design job, just stick to the standard \"table\" style for the resume. There is nothing wrong with the standard style, and it helps the recruiter screen your resume more efficiently since they are trained through experience to read that format. It would also help in the automatic scoring by the ATS. The last thing you want is for your application to be rejected because the system</li></ul>",
  "page-32": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">could not parse your resume for it to be scored. That said, I am not discouraging you from coming up with your own design. It is nice to read something different. Just be aware of the risks you could be taking.</li><li>Name your file firstname_lastname_resume.pdf instead of resume.pdf - it is easier for recruiters to search/forward.</li><li>PDF preferred over Word doc.</li><li>Be consistent about bullet points.</li><li>Your resume should not look sparse. (Come on, it is only 1 page! If you really have trouble filling it up, you are either not thinking hard enough, or not doing enough. In the case of the latter, consider working on your personal projects (i.e. stuff you can post on GitHub). That said, do not write stuff just to fill space. Read point 4.)</li><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">This should be common sense, but do not commit</li></ul>",
  "page-33": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">fraud, i.e. apply for the same job using a different name, or using your friend's resume to apply for the same job. Some ATS issues an indicator if they suspect the application to be a duplicate.</li><li>It's important to note the layout of your resume. If you choose to quickly upload your resume via an auto-fill program, understand that the program will read your resume from top to bottom, left to right. This is good to keep in mind when developing the layout of your resume.</li><li>Try to keep white space down to a minimum. This will also help reduce the length of your resume to one page. Reduce margins and paddings reasonably.</li></ul><h6>Listing Your Skills</h6><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is useful to list your relevant skills in a quick summary section for easy reading/matching. However, many people make the mistake of listing as many</p>",
  "page-34": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">skills/programming languages in the resume as possible. This may get you through the ATS scoring, but it definitely would not leave a good impression on the recruiter - the actual human reading your resume and deciding whether to call you up for an interview!</p><p>Ideally, if your resume is good enough, the recruiter should already know what you are proficient in. The skills section is just a quick summary/reiteration. <strong>Listing a bunch of technologies you claim you know without actually showing how you have worked with them is pointless.</strong></p><h6>Projects</h6><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">Ideally, 1-2 lines about the project, 2-3 lines about your role, what technologies you used, what you did, your learning, etc etc. These can be Final Year Projects, Research projects, projects for a particular class, freelance projects, or just personal projects (ie.</li></ul>",
  "page-35": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">GitHub stuff).</li><li>Ideally, 2 to 3 projects that align with your interests/position you are applying for.</li><li>Avoid using titles such as \"Project for [module code]\". Sorry, the recruiter has no idea what class is represented by the module code. Ideally, you want the project section to demonstrate your personality and skills, and be the talking point during the interview.</li></ul><h6>Online Profile/other Interests</h6><p>Here's the news - Recruiters do search for your name! Definitely pre-empt that by Googling/Facebook-ing/searching yourself on all forms of social media to see what turns up. Make sure your privacy settings are restricted so your online profile shows only the image you are trying to project.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If you have some space on your resume, it is good to</p>",

  "page-62": "<h3>Picking A Language</h3><hr class=\"section\"><p>Before anything else, you need to pick a programming language to do your interviews in. Most companies will let you code in any language you want, the only exception I know being Google, where they only allow candidates to pick from Java, C++, JavaScript or Python for their algorithmic coding interviews.</p><h5>Some Languages Are More Suited For Interviews</h5><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There are some languages which are more suitable than others for coding interviews and some languages you absolutely want to avoid. From my experience as an interviewer, most candidates pick Python or Java. Other commonly seen languages include JavaScript, Ruby and</p>",
  "page-63": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">C++. I would absolutely avoid lower level languages like C or Go, simply because they lack many standard library functions and data structures and some may require manual memory management.</p><p>Personally, Python is my de facto choice for algorithm coding interviews because it is succinct and has a pretty huge library of functions and data structures available. One of my top reasons for recommending Python is that it uses consistent APIs that operate on different data structures, such as <code>len()</code>, <code>for ... in ...</code> and slicing notation on sequences (strings/lists/tuples). Getting the last element in a sequence is <code>arr[-1]</code> and reversing it is simply <code>arr[::-1]</code>. You can achieve a lot with minimal syntax in Python.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Java is a decent choice too but having to constantly declare types in your code means extra keystrokes which results in slower coding/typing speed. This issue will be more apparent when you have to write on a whiteboard</p>",
  "page-64": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">during on-site interviews. The reasons for choosing/not choosing C++ are similar to Java. Ultimately, Python, Java and C++ are decent choices of languages.</p><h5>Use A Language You Are Familiar With</h5><p>Most of the time, it is recommended that you use a language that you are extremely familiar with rather than picking up a new language just for doing interviews because the company uses that language heavily or just because you want to show that you are trendy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If you are under time constraints, picking up a new language just for interviewing is hardly a good idea. Languages take time to master and if you are already spending most of your time and effort on mastering algorithms, there is barely spare effort left for mastering a new language. If you are familiar with using one of the mainstream languages, there isn't a strong reason to</p>",
  "page-65": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">learn a new language just for interviewing.</p><p>If you have been using Java at work for a while now and do not have time to be comfortably familiar with another language, I would recommend just sticking to Java instead of picking up Python from scratch just for the sake of interviews. Doing so, you can avoid having to context switch between languages during work vs interviews. Most of the time, the bottleneck is in the thinking and not the writing. It takes some getting used to before one becomes fluent in a language and be able to wield it with ease.</p><h5>The Exception To The Norm</h5><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One exception to the convention of allowing you to \"pick any programming language you want\" is when you are interviewing for a domain-specific position, such as Front End/iOS/Android Engineer roles, in which you would need to be familiar with coding in</p>",
  "page-66": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">JavaScript, Objective-C/Swift and Java respectively. If you need to use a data structure that the language does not support, such as a Queue or Heap in JavaScript, perhaps try asking the interviewer whether you can assume that you have a data structure that implements certain methods with specified time complexities. If the implementation of that data structure is not crucial to solving the problem, the interviewer will usually allow this. In reality, being aware of existing data structures and selecting the appropriate ones to tackle the problem at hand is more important than knowing the intricate implementation details.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Copy-paste errors are a common source of bugs even in day-to-day coding!</p><h5>After Coding</h5><p>After you have finished coding, do not immediately announce to the interviewer that you are done.

Even if there are things that are not directly monetary, if they relate to the job, write them down. If they tell you \"we're working on porting the front-end to Angular,\" write that down. If they say they have 20 employees,</p>",
  "page-138": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">write that down. You want as much information as you can. You'll forget a lot of this stuff, and it's going to be important in informing your final decision.</p><h6>Always Keep The Door Open</h6><p>Never give up your negotiating power until you're absolutely ready to make an informed, deliberate final decision. This means your job is to traverse as many of these decision points as possible without giving up the power to continue negotiating. Very frequently, your interlocutor will try to trick you into making a decision, or tie you to a decision you didn't commit to. You must keep verbally jiu-jitsu-ing out of these antics until you're actually ready to make your final decision.</p><h6>Information Is Power</h6><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">To protect your power in the negotiation, you must protect information as much as possible. A corollary of this rule is that you should not reveal to companies</p>",
  "page-139": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">what you're currently making. So given this offer, don't ask for more money or equity or anything of the sort. Don't comment on any specific details of the offer except to clarify them. Companies will ask about your current compensation at different stages in the process—some before they ever interview you, some after they decide to make you an offer. But be mindful of this, and protect information.</p><blockquote><p>\"Yeah, [COMPANY_NAME] sounds great! I really thought this was a good fit, and I'm glad that you guys agree. Right now I'm talking with a few other companies so I can't speak to the specific details of the offer until I'm done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I'm sure we'll be able to find a package that we're both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team.\"</p></blockquote><h6>Always Be Positive</h6>",
  "page-140": "<p>Even if the offer is bad, it's extremely important to remain positive and excited about the company. This is because your excitement is one of your most valuable assets in a negotiation.</p><p>Despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1 you still like the company, and that 2) you're still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out. Generally the most convincing thing to signal this is to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they're working on, and really want to see things work out.)</p><h6>Don't Be The Decision Maker</h6><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Even if you don't particularly care what your friends/family/husband/mother thinks, by mentioning them, you're no longer the only person the recruiter needs to win over. There's no point in them trying to</p>",
  "page-141": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">bully and intimidate you; the \"true decision-maker\" is beyond their reach. This is a classic technique in customer support and remediation. It's never the person on the phone's fault, they're just some poor schmuck doing their job. It's not their decision to make. This helps to defuse tension and give them more control of the situation.</p><blockquote><p>I'll look over some of these details and discuss it with my [FAMILY/CLOSE_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT_OTHER]. I'll reach out to you if I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I'll be in touch!</p></blockquote><p>It's much harder to pressure someone if they're not the final decision-maker. So take advantage of that.</p><h6>Have Alternatives</h6><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If you're already in the pipeline with other</p>",
  "page-142": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">companies (which you should be if you're doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let them know that you've just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency. Regardless of whether you know the expiration date, all offers expire at some point, so take advantage of that.</p><blockquote><p>Hello [PERSON],</p>\n<p>I just wanted to update you on my own process. I've just received an offer from [COMPANY] which is quite strong. That said, I'm really excited about [YOUR AMAZING COMPANY] and really want to see if we can make it work. Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to expedite the process?</p></blockquote><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Should you specifically mention the company that gave you an offer? Depends. If it's a well-known company or a competitor, then definitely mention it. If it's a no-name or unsexy company, you should just say</p>",
  "page-143": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">you received an offer. If it's expiring soon, you should mention that as well.</p><p>Either way, send out a letter like this to every single company you're talking to. No matter how hopeless or pointless you think your application is, you want to send this signal to everyone who is considering you in the market.</p><p>Companies care that you've received other offers. They care because each company knows that their own process is noisy, and the processes of most other companies are also noisy. But a candidate having multiple offers means that they have multiple weak signals in their favor. Combined, these converge into a much stronger signal than any single interview. It's like knowing that a student has a strong SAT score, and GPA, and won various scholarships. Sure, it's still possible that they're a dunce, but it's much harder for that to be true.</p>",
  "page-144": "<p>This is not to say that companies respond proportionally to these signals, or that they don't overvalue credentials and brands. They do. But caring about whether you have other offers and valuing you accordingly is completely rational.</p><p>Tell other companies that you've received offers. Give them more signals so that they know you're a valued and compelling candidate. And understand why this changes their mind about whether to interview you.</p><p>Your goal should be to have as many offers overlapping at the same time as possible. This will maximize your window for negotiating.</p><p>Have a strong BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement and communicate it.)</p><blockquote class=\"  \"><p>I 've received another offer from [OTHER CORP] that's very compelling on salary, but I really love the mission of [YOUR COMPANY] and think that it</blockquote>",
  "page-145": "<blockquote class=\"no-indent  \">would overall be a better fit for me.\nI'm also considering going back to grad school and getting a Master's degree in Postmodern Haberdashery. I'm excited about [YOUR COMPANY] though and would love to join the team, but the package has to make sense if I'm going to forego a life of ironic hatmaking.</p></blockquote><h6>Proclaim Reasons For Everything</h6><p>It's kind of a brain-hack, both for yourself and for your negotiating partner. Just stating a reason (any reason makes your request feel human and important. It's not you being greedy, it's you trying to fulfill your goals.)</p><p>The more unobjectionable and sympathetic your reason, the better. If it's medical expenses, or paying off student loans, or taking care of family, you'll bring tears to their eyes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Just go with it, state a reason for everything, and</p>",
  "page-146": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">you'll find recruiters more willing to become your advocate.</p><h6>Be Motivated By More Than Just Money</h6><p>You should be motivated by money too of course, but it should be one among many dimensions you're optimizing for. How much training you get, what your first project will be, which team you join, or even who your mentor will be—these are all things you can and should negotiate.</p><p>Of course, to negotiate well you need to understand the other side's preferences. You want to make the deal better for both of you.</p><h6>Understand What They Value</h6><p>Remember that you can always get salary raises as you continue to work at the company, but there's only one point at which you can get a signing bonus.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The easiest thing for a company to give though is</p>",
  "page-147": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">stock (if the company offers stock). Companies like giving stock because it invests you in the company and aligns interests. It also shifts some of the risk from the company over to you and burns less cash.</p><h6>Be Winnable</h6><p>This is more than just giving the company the impression that you like them (which you continually should). But more so that you must give any company you're talking to a clear path on how to win you. Don't bullshit them or play stupid games. Be clear and unequivocal with your preferences and timeline.</p><p>Don't waste their time or play games for your own purposes. Even if the company isn't your dream company, you must be able to imagine at least some package they could offer you that would make you sign. If not, politely turn them down.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
