One of my top reasons for recommending Python is that it uses consistent APIs that operate on different data structures, such as <code>len()</code>, <code>for ... in ...</code> and slicing notation on sequences (strings/lists/tuples). Getting the last element in a sequence is <code>arr[-1]</code> and reversing it is simply <code>arr[::-1]</code>. You can achieve a lot with minimal syntax in Python."

If you need to use a data structure that the language does not support, such as a Queue or Heap in JavaScript, perhaps try asking the interviewer whether you can assume that you have a data structure that implements certain methods with specified time complexities. If the implementation of that data structure is not crucial to solving the problem, the interviewer will usually allow this. In reality, being aware of existing data structures and selecting the appropriate ones to tackle the problem at hand is more important than knowing the intricate implementation details."

A tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution would not work. |\n| ✅ | Clarify input format and range. Ask whether input can be assumed to be well-formed and non-null. |\n| ✅ | Work through a small example to ensure you understood the question. |\n| ✅ | Explain a high level approach even if it is a brute force one. |\n| ✅ | Improve upon the approach and optimize. Reduce duplicated work and cache repeated computations. |\n| ✅ | Think carefully, then state and explain the time and space complexity of your approaches. |\n| ✅ | If stuck, think about related problems you have seen before and how they were solved. Check out the <a href=\"algorithms/introduction.md\">tips</a> in this section. |\n| ❌ | Ignore information given to you. Every piece is important. |\n| ❌ | Jump into coding straightaway. |\n| ❌ | Start coding without interviewer's green light. |\n| ❌ | Appear too unsure about your approach or analysis. |"

Clear variable names, consistent operator spacing, proper indentation, etc. |\n| ✅ | Type/write at a reasonable speed. |\n| ✅ | As much as possible, write actual compilable code, not pseudocode. |\n| ✅ | Write in a modular fashion. Extract out chunks of repeated code into functions. |\n| ✅ | Ask for permission to use trivial functions without having to implement them; saves you some time. |\n| ✅ | Use the hints given by the interviewer. |\n| ✅ | Demonstrate mastery of your chosen programming language. |\n| ✅ | Demonstrate technical knowledge in data structures and algorithms. |\n| ✅ | If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting (no time constraints). E.g., I would write a regex to parse this string rather than using <code>split()</code> which may not cover all cases. |\n| ✅ | Practice whiteboard space-management skills. |\n| ⚠️ | Reasonable defensive coding. Check for nulls, empty collections, etc. Can omit if input validity has been clarified with the interviewer. |\n| ❌ | Remain quiet the whole time. |\n| ❌ | Spend too much time writing comments. |\n| ❌ | Use extremely verbose variable names. |\n| ❌ | Copy and paste code without checking. |\n| ❌ | Interrupt your interviewer when they are talking. Usually if they speak, they are trying to give you hints or steer you in the right direction. |\n| ❌ | Write too big (takes up too much space) or too small (illegible) if on a whiteboard. |"

At the end of the interview, both interviewer and interviewees can provide feedback to each other for the purpose of improvement.
