##### What is this?

The **Tech Interview Handbook** contains carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview with a focus on algorithms. While there are a ton of interview resources on the internet, the best ones are either not free, or they do not cover the complete interview process, usually only focusing on algorithms.

##### Why do I want this?

This repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.

##### Who is this for?

Whether you are a beginner to technical interviews or a seasoned engineer who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, the Tech Interview Handbook has got you covered.

###  Landscape


Most of the content covered here will be specific to the Bay Area. Landscape differences due to geographical location are mentioned briefly [below](#geographical-location).

##### Career prospects as a Software Engineer

###### High Demand

Almost every domain leverages on technology, hence Software Engineers are needed in almost every industry. Demand for engineers is higher than supply, leading to generally high-paying jobs. Moreover, the demand is continuously growing.

###### Stable career

Computer Science is rapidly gaining popularity and engineering is a highly-regarded professional career. Unlike the creative industry, you do not have to be the top 1% of the industry to lead a comfortable life. An engineer fresh out of college working at a Silicon Valley company (both large companies and startups) can expect to receive a starting salary of more than USD 100,000 and it just gets better from there.

###### Require lifelong learning

Technology industry is an extremely fast-moving one. Many technologies used today didn't even exist/were popular a decade ago; in 2009, mobile app development and blockchain were pretty much unheard of. Engineers constantly need to upgrade their skills to stay relevant to the demands of the job market. Engineering is a great career for passionate individuals who like to learn.

###### Flexible

A software engineering job is perhaps the most flexible job that exists in terms of hours, location and environment. Physical location is usually not an issue and there are many tech companies that are fully remote. There's no formal attire to be worn and working hours are generally flexible. Your co-workers would stare at you weirdly if you came to work wearing a shirt and tie.

##### Internships vs full-time

If you dream of working at a top-tier tech company one day, getting hired via an intern conversion is by far the easiest way to achieve that. Internship interviews are extremely short (usually just 2 rounds whereas interviews for full-time roles are usually 4-5 rounds). Internships allow you to work at a company over a short period of time (3 months or so) and helps in understanding the company and engineering culture better. Companies also tend to give higher return job offers to high performing interns as they have proven to be effective at the job and fits into the culture; hence hiring them is considered to be relatively low-risk.

Top tech companies pay a ridiculous amount for interns:

##### Company size

Companies have different focuses depending on the stage they are at and the types of work to be done can also be vastly different. In the earlier stages where product-market fit hasn't been found, companies would be rapidly iterating on products and features, whereas larger companies that have already found the right product will focus on scaling their infrastructure and growing their users. Liquid compensation is also lower at early-stage companies due to the equity not being worth any money, but there is the chance of earning a lot more if/when the company IPOs or gets acquired.

|  | Early-stage Startup | Late-stage Startup | Large Company |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Company Size | <100 | 100-1000 | >1000 |
| Compensation | Base salary is a bit higher than big companies. Higher equity amount but its value is hard to judge as the company's valuation is unclear and stocks are not worth money yet. | Base salary is a bit higher than big companies. Company valuation is clearer and stocks have higher chance of being worth money. | Depends on the prestige of the company. Compensation is usually market standard or better. Stocks are worth money if company has gone public. |
| Types of Work | Mainly product development. Engineers have to wear multiple hats - Front End, Back End, DevOps, Design, etc. | Product development and some infra. | Diverse roles and specialized work; dedicated people for each role. Infra work is more common. Also more opportunities for internal transfers. |
| Career Ladders | Unstructured. No (or very vague) career levels. No formal mentorship nor training. | Somewhat structured. | Very structured. Well-defined career levels. |
| Iteration Speed | Extremely fast. Struggling to find product market fit. | Moderate. Has found product market fit, trying to grow user base. | Stable product with wide user base. Have to roll out changes incrementally and run experiments. |

##### Geographical location

|  | US (Silicon Valley/NY) | Singapore |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starting Pay | USD 100,000 | Monthly $4320 (Median), $5000 (75th percentile) |
| Talent Access | Global talent, diverse nationalities and backgrounds | Usually regional, mostly Asians |
| Types of Companies | HQ of large companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc), Startups | Branch offices of large companies, Startups |
| Types of Engineering Work | Depends on size of office/company | Both product and infra (building new programming languages, frameworks, and tools) |

###  Resume


The following content is by Christina Ng and rephrased for the purpose of this handbook. You can follow her on [Medium](https://medium.com/@christinang89) or [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christina-Ng).

##### How your resume is screened

While many engineers can be rather qualified for the role they are applying for, they miss out on getting a shot at the interview as they might never get past resume screening. The main issue was that they do not understand how recruiters worked.

Before writing your resume, it is important to understand the recruiting structure and how recruiting is done.

###### The skill set checklist

Before opening up a position/starting the search for candidates, I usually consult very closely with the team manager/decision maker to find out the specific skill sets that are relevant for the position. These skill sets are typically grouped into "Must have", "Good to have", and "Special bonus".

- "Must have" — Typically, most of the must-haves include a degree (or not) in a relevant technical field, some years (or not) of experience in a particular programming language or technology.
- "Good to have" — Includes experience/familiarity with secondary languages/technologies which may not be directly relevant to what the candidate would be working on, but could be required due to some interfacing with other components of the project. It could also include softer skills such as being a good team player, clear communication, etc.
- "Special bonus" — Recognized skill sets/experiences which are difficult to come by. Probably not a requirement, but would definitely be useful for the position.

Now that I am armed with this list, the search for candidates begin.

Typically, I do not seek that "one perfect candidate". What I seek for is the "best fit candidate". The search is essentially a numbers game. I know that for a specific job posting, there would perhaps be X applicants. At each stage of the interview process, some percentage of the candidates will be eliminated, leaving only a final Y% of the initial pool to choose from. Since Y tends to be a rather small number, recruiters will try to maximize X.

###### The 10 seconds glance

When I am looking at your resume, I am doing a keyword match against the skill set checklist. If I see a good amount of the right keywords in your resume, it is a pass. If I need to spend more than 10 seconds trying to figure out what you are writing about, it is a fail. If I see an excessive amount of keywords (much looking like spam), it signals a red flag and goes into the "maybe". Depending on whether I think I have enough candidates for the day, you could eventually go into the pass or fail stack.

There are lots of articles writing about how recruiters only spend an average of about 10 seconds to screen each resume. The news is, this is true because resume screening is such a menial, robotic and repetitive task. In fact, many applicant tracking systems (ATS) now are so advanced that they can parse your resume automatically, search for specific keywords in your resume, and score your resume based on the weights pre-assigned to each keyword.

Finding a job is a two-way fit — the company wants someone with the relevant skills required, but it is also important for the applicant to fit in the company culture, and be able to gain something out of their stint. Hence, honesty is the single most important criteria in a resume.

There is a delicate balance between finding the right job vs. finding a job. Getting rejected does not always mean you are not good enough. Sometimes, it just means you are not a right fit for what the company is looking for.

When hiring fresh grads, I know that many of them will not have as much experience as someone who has years of industry experience. Hence, I would look out more for soft skills, such as attention to detail, initiative, passion, ability to get things done, etc. Note: this applies only if you have met the minimum threshold of proficiency/competency in the skill set checklist.

##### 10 ways To improve your resume

Now that you are aware of how recruiters screen your resume, here are 10 actionable ways you can do to improve your resume.

###### Cover letter

I've often received resumes with no cover letters, and I am perfectly fine with it. If you ask me, it is better to have no cover letter than to have a bad cover letter, especially if your cover letter is a "templated" content. An effective cover letter needs to highlight the fit between the job requirements and your skills/experiences. Do not just tell me what you have done in your cover letter; Tell me how it is a fit for what I am looking for.

Some small nitpicks:

- Make sure that the cover letter is addressed to the right person (either the name of the recruiter if it is known, or to a generic hiring manager) and company.
- Run a spell check.

###### Length of resume

Your resume should be kept to 1 page or a MAXIMUM of 2 pages. Include only your most recent and relevant experiences.

Information that a recruiter wants to know:

- Name, email, contact number.
- Education details: College, Major, GPA, Sample classes (optional, but if you list, make sure its classes that you scored well in and are relevant to your area of interest), academic awards, availability.
- If you have studied abroad, you can list that too.
- Projects that you have worked on.
- Work experience/co-curricular activities.
- Skills/other interests.
- Street cred - GitHub/Stack Overflow/LinkedIn profile (optional, but highly recommended).

Information nobody needs to know:

- Your profile picture. In the US, it is illegal to discriminate based on age, gender, race, or appearance.
- Address, home phone number, gender, religion, race, marital status, etc etc.
- Elementary, middle, high school.
- Your low GPA.
- Anything less recent than 3-4 years unless they are valid job experiences.
- Anything about your parents/siblings, their names, occupation, etc.
- Your life story.
- Anything not relevant to the job you are applying for (e.g. that you have a driving license when you are applying to be a programmer).

Ideally, keep it short, concise, but as detailed as possible.

###### GPA does matter

Everyone wants the cream of the crop. In the absence of a standardized test, GPA serves as that indicator. **While GPA may not necessarily be a good indication of how well you can code, a high GPA would definitely put you in a more favorable position to the recruiter.**

If your GPA is rather low, but you have loads of technical experiences, you can try not listing your GPA in the resume. This kinda "forces" the recruiter to read through your projects/job experience, and perhaps grant you a first interview. If you manage to impress them, who cares about your GPA? But if your GPA is low and you do not have skills for the job... maybe you should work on one of them and revisit job applications later.

In a different scenario, some students have low GPA, but it might be due to some irrelevant classes which they did badly in. E.g. Student X is scoring A for all his programming classes, but did not do well for his language classes. If I am hiring a developer, Student X would still be a suitable candidate despite his low GPA. In such cases, it might even be recommended to attach a transcript along with the resume.

Also, when you list your GPA/results, try to benchmark it. Instead of simply listing 4.6, write 4.6/5.0 (First Class Honors or Summa Cum Laude). To the recruiter, 4.6 does not mean anything if he/she is not familiar with your grading system.

###### Be clear about your objectives

Are you looking for a summer internship/full-time employment? What position are you applying for? Read the job description and know the job you are applying for!

**"Work experience" does not mean any work experience; it means _relevant_ work experience.** If you are applying for a developer position, the recruiter is not interested to know that you were a student escort for girls walking back to their apartments at night, nor that you were a cashier at Starbucks. You would be better off writing about the project you did for some programming class - yes, even if it was just a school project. Tailor your experiences and projects according to the job you are applying for. Pick relevant details to emphasize on and do not be hesitant to drop stuff completely if they are totally irrelevant. Quality over quantity.

- Make sure the description is comprehensive. Avoid writing "Software engineering intern - write code". You are better off not writing anything.
- Based on my experience, most fresh grads do not have extremely relevant job experience (unless you are lucky to have scored a really rewarding internship). For developer positions, I think it is ok to not have any job experience and just list projects.

###### Reverse chronological order

Always list your resume in reverse chronological order - the most recent at the top. Recruiters are more interested in what you have worked on recently than what you worked on 3 years ago. Chances are, you probably forgot the details too anyway.

###### Make sure you are contactable

- Get a proper email account with ideally your first name and last name, eg. "john.doe@gmail.com" instead of "angrybirds88@gmail.com".
- If you are using your school's .edu email, try to have an alias like "john.doe@xxx.edu" instead of "a002342342@xxx.edu".
- Avoid emails like "me@christi.na" or "admin@[mycooldomain].com" -- because it is very prone to typo errors.
- Make sure the number you have listed is the best way to reach you. The last thing you want is to miss the call from the recruiter because you typed the wrong number, or you are not available on that number during office hours (most probably the times the recruiter will call).

###### Layout/Formatting/Design

- Be consistent about the way you format your resume. Italics, underline, bold, and how they are used.
- Keep to a single standard font (avoid fancy fonts like Comic Sans or whatever) and do not have too many varying styles/font sizes/color
- Be consistent about the way you list your dates (eg. May 2011 - Aug 2011). Avoid using numerals for both month and date due to the difference in style for MMDD and DDMM in different countries. Dates like "Aug 2011 - June 12" just show that you have zero attention to detail.
- Unless you are applying for a design job, just stick to the standard "table" style for the resume. There is nothing wrong with the standard style, and it helps the recruiter screen your resume more efficiently since they are trained through experience to read that format. It would also help in the automatic scoring by the ATS. The last thing you want is for your application to be rejected because the system could not parse your resume for it to be scored. That said, I am not discouraging you from coming up with your own design. It is nice to read something different. Just be aware of the risks you could be taking.
- Name your file `firstname_lastname_resume.pdf` instead of `resume.pdf` - it is easier for recruiters to search/forward.
- PDF preferred over Word doc.
- Be consistent about bullet points.
- Your resume should not look sparse. (Come on, it is only 1 page!) If you really have trouble filling it up, you are either not thinking hard enough, or not doing enough. In the case of the latter, consider working on your personal projects (i.e. stuff you can post on GitHub). That said, do not write stuff just to fill space. Read point 4.
- This should be common sense, but do not commit fraud, i.e. apply for the same job using a different name, or using your friend's resume to apply for the same job. Some ATS issues an indicator if they suspect the application to be a duplicate.
- It's important to note the layout of your resume. If you choose to quickly upload your resume via an auto-fill program, understand that the program will read your resume from top to bottom, left to right. This is good to keep in mind when developing the layout of your resume.
- Try to keep white space down to a minimum. This will also help reduce the length of your resume to one page. Reduce margins and paddings reasonably.

###### Listing your skills

It is useful to list your relevant skills in a quick summary section for easy reading/matching. However, many people make the mistake of listing as many skills/programming languages in the resume as possible. This may get you through the ATS scoring, but it definitely would not leave a good impression on the recruiter - the actual human reading your resume and deciding whether to call you up for an interview!

Ideally, if your resume is good enough, the recruiter should already know what you are proficient in. The skills section is just a quick summary/reiteration. **Listing a bunch of technologies you claim you know without actually showing how you have worked with them is pointless.**

###### Projects

- Ideally, 1-2 lines about the project, 2-3 lines about your role, what technologies you used, what you did, your learning, etc etc. These can be Final Year Projects, Research projects, projects for a particular class, freelance projects, or just personal projects (ie. GitHub stuff).
- Ideally, 2 to 3 projects that align with your interests/position you are applying for.
- Avoid using titles such as "Project for [module code]". Sorry, the recruiter has no idea what class is represented by the module code. Ideally, you want the project section to demonstrate your personality and skills, and be the talking point during the interview.

###### Online profile/other interests

Here's the news - Recruiters do search for your name! Definitely pre-empt that by Googling/Facebook-ing/searching yourself on all forms of social media to see what turns up. Make sure your privacy settings are restricted so your online profile shows only the image you are trying to project.

If you have some space on your resume, it is good to list additional interests outside of coding. Eg. skiing, water sports, soccer, etc etc. Gives the interviewer something to talk to you about. It also shows that you are a well-rounded individual/cool person to hang out with.

#### Interview Process




title: Interview Formats
---

Interviews are a multi-stage process and each stage can consist of vastly different formats.

##### Various Formats

###### Pop Quiz

Pop quizzes are meant to be a quick and dirty way of weeding out extremely weak (or even non-technical) candidates. They are structured questions and have clear-cut answers which makes them possible to be administered by recruiters/non-technical folks. It is not a very common interview format these days.

Examples:

- What is 4 & 5? Answer: 4
- What is the time complexity of bubble sort? Answer: O(n^2)

###### Take Home Assignment

There has been numerous debates on whether asking algorithm questions are a good way of assessing individual abilities as they aren't exactly the most relevant skills needed for a job. Take home assignment is a format designed to address the shortcomings of the algorithm interview by getting candidates to work on larger projects which allow them to demonstrate software design skills.

However, this interview format takes up more time from both the candidates and the company and hence it is not as commonly seen in large companies where they have a high volume of candidates. This format is more common among startups and small companies.

Examples

- Build a flights listing app
- Build a snake game

###### Phone Interview

Phone interview are the most common format and every candidate will face this at least once while interviewing. You will be asked to speak with an interviewer either over a phone call or VoIP (Skype/Hangout). A question will be given to you and you will work on that question using an online collaborative editor (CoderPad/CodePen/Google Docs).

You are usually not allowed to execute the code even if the editor supports execution. So don't rely on that for verifying the correctness of your solution. Formats would differ slightly depending on the roles you are applying to. Many companies like to use [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/) for collaborative code editing. CoderPad supports running of the program, so you is possible that you are asked to fix your code such that it can be run. For front end interviews, many companies like to use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), and it will be worth your time to familiarize yourself with the user interfaces of such web-based coding environments.

###### Onsite

If you have made it to this stage, congratulations! This is usually the final stage before an offer decision. Candidates who made it to the onsite stage will be required to have an in-person interview at the office. If you are an overseas candidate, companies might even fly you in and pay for your accommodations!

The onsite stage usually consists of multiple rounds (coding, system design, behavioral) and is expected to last for a few hours. Since you are onsite, it is possible that you will be asked to do a whiteboard exercise with an interviewer, usually either solving an algorithm question or doing a system design question. It ia also possible that you have to bring you own laptops and work on a project/solve a coding problem on the spot.

For onsite interviews at smaller (non-public) companies, most will allow (and prefer) that you use your own laptop. Hence it is important that you prepare your development environment in advance.

If the company provides lunch, you might also have a lunch session with an employee where you can find out more about the company culture.

title: Self Introduction
---

You can rephrase the question like this:

"Tell me about your journey into tech. How did you get interested in coding, and why was web development a good fit for you? How is that applicable to our **\_** role or company goals?"

##### The Elevator Pitch

The Elevator Pitch is an indispensable tool for you as you move forward in your career. An Elevator Pitch is just that -- you pitch yourself to an executive that you want to impress and only have a short elevator ride to do so. Whether you're at a job fair with hundreds of other candidates and you have limited time or you are simply explaining who you are to a potential connection or client, it is important to be able to clearly and accurately describe your knowledge and skillset quickly and succinctly. Here are some tips to develop a good Elevator Pitch:

###### Sell yourself

- The whole point of this is to get you a job or make a connection that benefits your career.
- Tell them who you are, who you work for (or school and major), and what you do.

###### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Tell them some highlights from your favorite / most impressive projects.
- Do not delve into the depths of how you reverse engineered a game and decrypted a packet to predict when to use your DKP on a drop. Tell them the executive summary: "I reverse engineered X game by decrypting Y packet to predict Z." If this catches their interest, they _will_ ask further questions on their own.

###### Why do _they_ want _you_?

- This is where you use your knowledge of the company, knowledge of their technology stack(s), your unique talent that they want, etc. in order to solidify your ability to contribute to their company.

###### Practice!

- Lastly, you must practice your pitch! Having a great, succinct summary of your skills only helps if you can actually deliver it rapidly! You should practice keeping a quick but easy-to-follow pace that won't overwhelm them but won't bore them. It's a precarious balance, but can be ironed out with practice.

Having an Elevator Pitch on hand is a great way to create a network and happen upon new job opportunities. There will often be times when you can't prepare for an interview or meeting, and it is incredibly handy to have a practiced pitch.

title: Picking a Language
---

Before anything else, you need to pick a programming language to do your interviews in. Most companies will let you code in any language you want, the only exception I know being Google, where they only allow candidates to pick from Java, C++, JavaScript or Python for their algorithmic coding interviews.

##### Some languages are more suited for interviews

There are some languages which are more suitable than others for coding interviews and some languages you absolutely want to avoid. From my experience as an interviewer, most candidates pick Python or Java. Other commonly seen languages include JavaScript, Ruby and C++. I would absolutely avoid lower level languages like C or Go, simply because they lack many standard library functions and data structures and some may require manual memory management.

Personally, Python is my de facto choice for algorithm coding interviews because it is succinct and has a pretty huge library of functions and data structures available. One of my top reasons for recommending Python is that it uses consistent APIs that operate on different data structures, such as `len()`, `for ... in ...` and slicing notation on sequences (strings/lists/tuples). Getting the last element in a sequence is `arr[-1]` and reversing it is simply `arr[::-1]`. You can achieve a lot with minimal syntax in Python.

Java is a decent choice too but having to constantly declare types in your code means extra keystrokes which results in slower coding/typing speed. This issue will be more apparent when you have to write on a whiteboard during on-site interviews. The reasons for choosing/not choosing C++ are similar to Java. Ultimately, Python, Java and C++ are decent choices of languages.

##### Use a language you are familiar with

Most of the time, it is recommended that you use a language that you are extremely familiar with rather than picking up a new language just for doing interviews because the company uses that language heavily or just because you want to show that you are trendy.

If you are under time constraints, picking up a new language just for interviewing is hardly a good idea. Languages take time to master and if you are already spending most of your time and effort on mastering algorithms, there is barely spare effort left for mastering a new language. If you are familiar with using one of the mainstream languages, there isn't a strong reason to learn a new language just for interviewing.

If you have been using Java at work for a while now and do not have time to be comfortably familiar with another language, I would recommend just sticking to Java instead of picking up Python from scratch just for the sake of interviews. Doing so, you can avoid having to context switch between languages during work vs interviews. Most of the time, the bottleneck is in the thinking and not the writing. It takes some getting used to before one becomes fluent in a language and be able to wield it with ease.

##### The exception to the norm

One exception to the convention of allowing you to "pick any programming language you want" is when you are interviewing for a domain-specific position, such as Front End/iOS/Android Engineer roles, in which you would need to be familiar with coding in JavaScript, Objective-C/Swift and Java respectively. If you need to use a data structure that the language does not support, such as a Queue or Heap in JavaScript, perhaps try asking the interviewer whether you can assume that you have a data structure that implements certain methods with specified time complexities. If the implementation of that data structure is not crucial to solving the problem, the interviewer will usually allow this. In reality, being aware of existing data structures and selecting the appropriate ones to tackle the problem at hand is more important than knowing the intricate implementation details.

##### Recap CS Fundamentals

If you have been out of college for a while, it is highly advisable to review CS fundamentals — Algorithms and Data Structures. Personally, I prefer to review as I practice, so I scan through my college notes and review the various algorithms as I work on algorithm problems from LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview.

This [interviews repository](https://github.com/kdn251/interviews) by Kevin Naughton Jr. served as a quick refresher for me.

The Medium publication [basecs](https://medium.com/basecs) by [Vaidehi Joshi](https://medium.com/@vaidehijoshi) is also a great and light-hearted resource to recap on the various data structures and algorithms.

If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out [Lago](https://github.com/yangshun/lago), a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that is able to be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.

##### Mastery through practice

Next, gain familiarity and mastery of the algorithms and data structures in your chosen programming language.

###### Practice coding questions

Practice coding algorithms using your chosen language. While [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) is a good resource for practice, I prefer being able to type code, run it and get instant feedback. There are various Online Judges such as [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/) for you to practice questions online and get used to the language. From experience, LeetCode questions are the most similar to the kind of questions being asked in interviews whereas HackerRank and CodeForces questions resemble competitive programming questions. If you practice enough LeetCode questions, there is a good chance that you would have seen/done your actual interview question (or some variant) on LeetCode before. If you are more of a visual person, [Coderust](https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656) explains the common algorithm questions through step-by-step visualizations which makes understanding the solutions much easier.

###### Space/time complexities

Learn and understand the time and space complexities of the common operations in your chosen language. For Python, this [page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) will come in handy. Also find out the underlying sorting algorithm that is being used in the language's `sort()` function and its time and space complexity (in Python its Timsort which is a hybrid sort). After completing a question on LeetCode, I usually add the time and space complexities of the written code as comments above the function body to remind myself to analyze the algorithm after I am done with the implementation.

###### Practice good coding style

Read up on the recommended coding style for your language and stick to it. If you have chosen Python, refer to the PEP 8 Style Guide. If you have chosen Java, refer to Google's Java Style Guide.

###### Internalize the pitfalls

Find out and be familiar with the common pitfalls and caveats of the language. If you point them out during the interview and intelligently avoid falling into them, you will usually impress the interviewer and that results in bonus points for your feedback, regardless of whether the interviewer is familiar with the language or not.

###### Broaden exposure

Gain a broad exposure to questions from various topics. In the second half of the article I mention algorithm topics and practice questions for each topic. Do around 100–200 LeetCode questions and you should be good.

Practice, practice and more practice!

title: Best Practice Questions
---

Here is a suggested schedule for revising and practicing algorithm questions on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com). Sign up for an account if you don't already have one, it's critical to your success in interviewing!

When practicing, you are advised to treat it like a real coding interview and check through thoroughly before submitting. Consider even manually coming up with some test cases and running through them to verify correctness!

##### Week 1 - Sequences

In week 1, we will start off easy and do a mix of easy and medium questions on arrays and strings. Arrays and strings are the most common types of questions to be found in interviews; gaining familiarity with them will help in building strong fundamentals to better handle tougher questions.

- [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

- [Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)
- [Merge K Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

##### Week 3 - Non-Linear Data Structures

The focus of week 3 is on non-linear data structures like trees, graphs and heaps. You should be familiar with the various tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order) algorithms and graph traversal algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first search. In my experience, using more advanced graph algorithms (Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall) is quite rare and usually not necessary.

- [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)
- [Invert/Flip Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
- [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

- [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)
- [Encode and Decode Strings (Leetcode Premium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/)

##### Week 4 - More Data Structures

Week 4 builds up on knowledge from previous weeks but questions are of increased difficulty. Expect to see such level of questions during interviews. You get more practice on more advanced data structures such as (but not exclusively limited to) heaps and tries.

- [Add and Search Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-and-search-word-data-structure-design/)
- [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)

- [Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph (Leetcode Premium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)

##### Week 5 - Dynamic Programming

Week 5 focuses on Dynamic Programming (DP) questions. Personally as an interviewer, I'm not a fan of DP questions as they are not really applicable to practical scenarios and frankly if I were made to do the tough DP questions during my interviews I'd not have gotten the job. However, companies like Google still ask DP questions and if joining Google is your dream, DP is unavoidable.

DP questions can be hard to master and the best way to get better at them is... you guessed it - practice! Be familiar with the concepts of memoization and backtracking.

Practically speaking the return of investment (ROI) on studying and practicing for DP questions is very low. Hence DP questions are less important/optional and you should only do them if you're very keen to have all bases covered.

title: During the Coding Interview
---

Congratulations, you are ready to put your skills into practice! In a real coding interview, you will be given a technical question by the interviewer, write code in a real-time collaborative editor (phone screen) or on a whiteboard (on-site) to solve the problem within 30–45 minutes. This is where the real fun begins!

Your interviewer will be looking out for signals that you fit the requirements of the role and it is up to you to display those signals to them. Initially it may feel weird to be talking while you are coding as most programmers do not have the habit of explaining out loud as they are typing code. However, it is hard for the interviewer to know what you are thinking just by looking at the code that you type. If you communicate your approach to the interviewer before you start coding, you can validate your approach with them and the both of you can agree upon an acceptable approach.

##### Before the interview (remote)

For phone screens/remote interviews, prepare paper and pen/pencil to jot down and visualize stuff. If you are given a question on trees and graphs, it usually helps if you draw out some examples of the data structure given in the question.

Use earphones and make sure you are in a quiet environment. You definitely do not want to be holding a phone in one hand and only be able to type with the other. Try avoiding using speakers because if the echo is bad, communication is harder and repeating of words will just result in loss of valuable time.

##### Self introduction

Prepare a self introduction that follows the following outline (inspired by "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle McDowell):

1. A sentence about your current or most recent role.
1. A few sentences about your (academic) background. What did you focus on?
1. Some sentences about your professional experience after school/university. Where did you work? What projects did you deal with? What where typical challenges and tasks? Which technologies did you use?
1. Mention one to two sentences about what you do outside of work, if it is relevant for the role.
1. Finish with a statement saying why you are seeking a new job opportunity and why you are interested in the role you applied for.

An example of the above could be:

> I'm John Doe and currently a Software Engineer at Google.
>
> My background is in Computer Science, where I received my bachelor's degree at MIT and my Master's degree at Stanford. I mainly did research on how to decrease complexity of search algorithms.
>
> After university, I started to work at Microsoft as a Software Engineer. It was a great experience as I was working in the Office team contributing to MS Word and MS Powerpoint. I learned a lot about C# and .NET back then. After about two years, I got an offer from Google where I have been working since then. I'm now leading the Search Optimization team and have gained a lot of knowledge in scalability and domain knowledge. My daily tasks consist of optimizing search queries and mentoring junior engineers.
>
> Outside of work I develop a on open source projects written in Python. Examples of some open source projects I created are &lt;insert examples&gt;.
>
> I'm now seeking new job opportunities in the Boston area since I'm relocating for personal reasons. In particular I think Boston Dynamics is a perfect fit for my interests as well as my skill set.

##### Upon receiving the question

Many candidates jump into coding the moment they hear the question. That is usually a big mistake. Take a moment to repeat the question back at the interviewer and make sure that you understand exactly what they are asking. Repeating back/rephrasing the question will reduce chances of miscommunication.

Always seek clarification about the question upon hearing it even if it you think it is clear to you. You might discover something that you have missed out and it also sends a signal to the interviewer that you are a careful person who pays attention to details. Some interviewers deliberately omit important details to see if you ask the right questions.

Some common questions you can ask:

- How big is the size of the input?
- How big is the range of values?
- What kind of values are there? Are there negative numbers? Floating points? Will there be empty inputs?
- Are there duplicates within the input?
- What are some extreme cases of the input?
- Can I destroy the original array/graph/data structure?
- How is the input stored? If you are given a dictionary of words, is it a list of strings or a Trie?

After you have sufficiently clarified the scope and intention of the problem, explain your high level approach to the interviewer even if it is a naive solution. If you are stuck, consider various approaches and explain out loud why it will/will not work. Sometimes your interviewer might drop hints and lead you towards the right path.

Start with a brute force approach, communicate it to the interviewer, explain the time and space complexity and why it is bad. It is unlikely that the brute force approach will be one that you will be coding. At this point, the interviewer will usually pop the dreaded "Can we do better?" question, meaning that they are looking for a more optimal approach. In my opinion, this is usually the hardest part of the interview. In general, look for repeated work and try to optimize them by potentially caching the calculated result somewhere and reference it later, rather than having to compute it all over again. There are some tips on tackling topic-specific questions that I dive into details below.

Only start coding after you and your interviewer have agreed on an approach and they have given you the green light.

##### What to do when stuck

Getting stuck during coding interviews is extremely common. But do not worry, that is part of the process and is a test of your problem solving abilities. Here are some tips to try out when you are stuck:

- Talk through what you initially thought might work and explain why it doesn't
  - This can help guide you on the right track by avoiding the pitfalls
- Come up with more test cases and write them down
  - A pattern may emerge
- Think about how you would solve it without a program
  - You may spot a pattern and come up with a general algorithm for it
- Recall past questions related to the topic, what similar questions in the past have you encountered and what techniques did you use?
- Enumerate through the common data structures and whether they can be applied to the question
  - Dictionaries/maps are extremely common in making algorithms more efficient
- Look out for repeated work and determine if you can cache those computations
  - Trade off memory for speed

##### While coding

Write your code with good coding style. Reading code written by others is usually not an enjoyable task. Reading horribly-formatted code by others makes it worse. Your goal is to make your interviewer understand the code you have written so that they can quickly evaluate if your code does what you say it does and whether it solves the given problem. Use clear variable names, avoid single letter names unless they are for iteration. However, if you are coding on a whiteboard, you might not want to use extremely verbose variable names for the sake of reducing the amount you have to write. Abbreviations are usually fine if you explain what it means beforehand.

Always be explaining what you are currently writing/typing to the interviewer. This is not about literally reading out what you are typing to the interviewer. Talk about the section of the code you are currently implementing at a higher level, explain why it is written as such and what it is trying to achieve.

While coding, if you find yourself copying and pasting code, consider whether it is necessary. If you find yourself copying and pasting one large chunk of code spanning multiple lines, it is usually an indicator that you can refactor by extracting those lines into a function and defining parameters for the differences in them. If it is just a single line you copied, usually it is fine. Do remember to change the respective variables in your copied line of code where relevant. Copy-paste errors are a common source of bugs even in day-to-day coding!

##### After coding

After you have finished coding, do not immediately announce to the interviewer that you are done. In most cases, your code is usually not perfect and contains some bugs or syntax errors. What you need to do now is to review your code.

Firstly, look through your code from start to finish as if it is the first time you are seeing it, as if it was written by someone else and you are trying to spot bugs in it. That's exactly what your interviewer will be doing. Look through and fix any minor issues you may find.

Next, come up with small test cases and step through the code (not your algorithm!) with those sample input. What interviewers usually do after you have finished coding would be to get you to write tests. It is a huge plus if you write tests for your code even before they prompt you to do so. You should be emulating a debugger when stepping through and jot down or say out the values of the important variables as you step through the lines of code.

If there are huge duplicated chunks of code in your solution, it would be a good chance to refactor it and demonstrate to the interviewer that you are one who values code quality. Also look out for places where you can do [short-circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation).

Lastly, give the time/space complexity of your code and explain why it is such. You can even annotate certain chunks of your code with the various time/space complexities to demonstrate your understanding of your code and the APIs of your chosen programming language. Explain any trade-offs in your current approach vs alternative approaches, possibly in terms of time/space.

If your interviewer is happy with the solution, the interview usually ends here. It is also not uncommon that the interviewer asks you extension questions, such as how you would handle the problem if the whole input is too large to fit into memory, or if the input arrives as a stream. This is a common follow-up question at Google where they care a lot about scale. The answer is usually a divide-and-conquer approach — perform distributed processing of the data and only read certain chunks of the input from disk into memory, write the output back to disk, and combine them later on.

title: Cheatsheet
---

This is a straight-to-the-point, distilled list of technical interview Do's and Don'ts, mainly for algorithmic interviews. Some of these may apply to only phone screens or whiteboard interviews, but most will apply to both. I revise this list before each of my interviews to remind myself of them and eventually internalized all of them to the point I do not have to rely on it anymore.

#### Legend

- ✅ = Do
- ❌ = Don't
- ⚠️ = Situational

###### Before interview

|  | Things |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Prepare pen, paper and earphones/headphones. |
| ✅ | Find a quiet environment with good Internet connection. |
| ✅ | Ensure webcam and audio are working. There were times I had to restart Chrome to get Hangouts to work again. |
| ✅ | Request for the option to interview over Hangouts/Skype instead of a phone call; it is easier to send links or text across. |
| ✅ | Decide on and be familiar with a programming language. |
| ✅ | Familiarize yourself with the coding environment (CoderPad/CodePen). Set up the coding shortcuts, turn on autocompletion, tab spacing, etc. |
| ✅ | Prepare answers to the [frequently-asked questions](behavioral-questions.md) in an interview. |
| ✅ | Prepare some [questions to ask](questions-to-ask.md) at the end of the interview. |
| ✅ | Dress comfortably. Usually you do not need to wear smart clothes, casual should be fine. T-shirts and jeans are acceptable at most places. |
| ✅ | Stay calm and composed. |
| ⚠️ | Turn off the webcam if possible. Most remote interviews will not require video chat and leaving it on only serves as a distraction. |

###### Introduction

|  | Things |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Introduce yourself in a few sentences under a minute or two. |
| ✅ | Mention interesting points that are relevant to the role you are applying for. |
| ✅ | Sound enthusiastic! Speak with a smile and you will naturally sound more engaging. |
| ❌ | Spend too long introducing yourself. The more time you spend talking the less time you have to code. |

###### Upon receiving the question

|  | Things |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Repeat the question back at the interviewer. |
| ✅ | Clarify any assumptions you made subconsciously. Many questions are under-specified on purpose. A tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution would not work. |
| ✅ | Clarify input format and range. Ask whether input can be assumed to be well-formed and non-null. |
| ✅ | Work through a small example to ensure you understood the question. |
| ✅ | Explain a high level approach even if it is a brute force one. |
| ✅ | Improve upon the approach and optimize. Reduce duplicated work and cache repeated computations. |
| ✅ | Think carefully, then state and explain the time and space complexity of your approaches. |
| ✅ | If stuck, think about related problems you have seen before and how they were solved. Check out the [tips](algorithms/introduction.md) in this section. |
| ❌ | Ignore information given to you. Every piece is important. |
| ❌ | Jump into coding straightaway. |
| ❌ | Start coding without interviewer's green light. |
| ❌ | Appear too unsure about your approach or analysis. |

###### During coding

|  | Things |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Explain what you are coding/typing to the interviewer, what you are trying to achieve. |
| ✅ | Practice good coding style. Clear variable names, consistent operator spacing, proper indentation, etc. |
| ✅ | Type/write at a reasonable speed. |
| ✅ | As much as possible, write actual compilable code, not pseudocode. |
| ✅ | Write in a modular fashion. Extract out chunks of repeated code into functions. |
| ✅ | Ask for permission to use trivial functions without having to implement them; saves you some time. |
| ✅ | Use the hints given by the interviewer. |
| ✅ | Demonstrate mastery of your chosen programming language. |
| ✅ | Demonstrate technical knowledge in data structures and algorithms. |
| ✅ | If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting (no time constraints). E.g., I would write a regex to parse this string rather than using `split()` which may not cover all cases. |
| ✅ | Practice whiteboard space-management skills. |
| ⚠️ | Reasonable defensive coding. Check for nulls, empty collections, etc. Can omit if input validity has been clarified with the interviewer. |
| ❌ | Remain quiet the whole time. |
| ❌ | Spend too much time writing comments. |
| ❌ | Use extremely verbose variable names. |
| ❌ | Copy and paste code without checking. |
| ❌ | Interrupt your interviewer when they are talking. Usually if they speak, they are trying to give you hints or steer you in the right direction. |
| ❌ | Write too big (takes up too much space) or too small (illegible) if on a whiteboard. |

###### After coding

|  | Things |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Scan through your code for mistakes as if it was your first time seeing code written by someone else. |
| ✅ | Check for off-by-one errors. |
| ✅ | Come up with more test cases. Try extreme test cases. |
| ✅ | Step through your code with those test cases. |
| ✅ | Look out for places where you can refactor. |
| ✅ | Reiterate the time and space complexity of your code. |
| ✅ | Explain trade-offs and how the code/approach can be improved if given more time. |
| ❌ | Immediately announce that you are done coding. Do the above first! |
| ❌ | Argue with the interviewer. They may be wrong but that is very unlikely given that they are familiar with the question. |

###### Wrap up

|  | Things |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Ask questions. More importantly, ask good and engaging questions that are tailored to the company! Pick some questions from [this list](questions-to-ask.md). |
| ✅ | Thank the interviewer. |
| ⚠️ | Ask about your interview performance. It can get awkward. |
| ❌ | End the interview without asking any questions. |

###### Post interview

|  | Things |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Record the interview questions and answers down as these can be useful for future reference. |
| ⚠️ | Send a follow up email to your interviewer(s) thanking them for their time and the opportunity to interview with them. |

title: Mock Interviews
---

Interviewing is a skill that you can get better at. The steps mentioned above can be rehearsed over and over again until you have fully internalized them and following those steps become second nature to you. A good way to practice is to find a friend to partner with and the both of you can take turns to interview each other.

A great resource for practicing mock coding interviews would be [interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/DMCa). interviewing.io provides free, anonymous practice technical interviews with Google and Facebook engineers, which can lead to real jobs and internships. By virtue of being anonymous during the interview, the inclusive interview process is de-biased and low risk. At the end of the interview, both interviewer and interviewees can provide feedback to each other for the purpose of improvement. Doing well in your mock interviews will unlock the jobs page and allow candidates to book interviews (also anonymously) with top companies like Uber, Lyft, Quora, Asana and more. For those who are totally new to technical interviews, you can even view [recorded interviews](https://interviewing.io/recordings) and see how phone interviews are like. Read more about them [here](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/interviewing-io-hopes-to-close-the-engineer-diversity-gap-with-anonymous-interviews/).

I have used interviewing.io both as an interviewer and an interviewee and found the experience to be really great! [Aline Lerner](https://twitter.com/alinelernerLLC), the CEO and co-founder of interviewing.io and her team are passionate about revolutionizing the technical interview process and helping candidates to improve their skills at interviewing. She has also published a number of technical interview-related articles on the [interviewing.io blog](http://blog.interviewing.io/). interviewing.io is still in beta now but I recommend signing up as early as possible to increase the likelihood of getting an invite.

Another platform that allows you to practice coding interviews is [Pramp](https://pramp.com/). Where interviewing.io matches potential job seekers with seasoned technical interviewers, Pramp takes a different approach. Pramp pairs you up with another peer who is also a job seeker and both of you take turns to assume the role of interviewer and interviewee. Pramp also prepares questions for you, along with suggested solutions and prompts to guide the interviewee.

Personally, I am not that fond of Pramp's approach because if I were to interview someone, I would rather choose a question I am familiar with. Also, many users of the platform do not have the experience of being interviewers and that can result in a horrible interview experience. There was once where my matched peer, as the interviewer, did not have the right understanding of the question and attempted to lead me down the wrong path of solving the question. However, this is more of a problem of the candidate than the platform though.

- **Situation** - The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.
- **Task** - What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods[1] use “Target” rather than “Task”. Job interview candidates who describe a “Target” they set themselves instead of an externally imposed “Task” emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance.
- **Action** - What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it and what the alternatives were.
- **Results** - What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives? What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?

title: Psychological Tricks
---

Here are some psychological tricks that will help you ace a job interview.

- Tailor your answers to the interviewer's age.
  - Generation Y interviewers (between 20 and 30): Bring along visual samples of your work and highlight your ability to multitask.
  - Generation X interviewers (between 30 and 50): Emphasize your creativity and mention how work/life balance contributes to your success.
  - Baby Boomer interviewers (between 50 and 70): Show that you work hard and demonstrate respect for what they've achieved.
- Hold your palms open or steeple your hands.
- Find something in common with your interviewer.
- Mirror the interviewer's body language.
- Compliment the interviewer and the organization without self-promoting.
  - Specifically, the students who ingratiated themselves praised the organization and indicated their enthusiasm for working there, and complimented the interviewer. They didn't play up the value of positive events they took credit for or take credit for positive events even if they weren't solely responsible.
- Show confidence and deference simultaneously.
  - In a job interview, that means showing deference to your interviewer, while also demonstrating self-confidence. One way to do that is to say something like, "I love your work on [whatever area]. It reminds me of my work on [whatever area]."
- Emphasize how you took control of events in your previous jobs.
  - To impress your interviewer, you should talk about past work experiences where you took initiative.
- Be candid about your weaknesses.
  - It's wiser to say something genuine like, "I'm not always the best at staying organized," which sounds more honest, and could make your interviewer more inclined to recommend you for the position.
- Speak expressively.
- Showcase your potential.
  - You might be tempted to tell your interviewer all about your past accomplishments — but research suggests you should focus more on what you could do in the future, if the organization hires you.

title: Negotiation
---

##### Ten Rules of Negotiation

Key points extracted from "Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer" [Part 1](http://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/) and [Part 2](https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/) by Haseeb Qureshi.

###### Get everything in writing

Note down EVERYTHING on your phone call with the recruiters as they may be helpful later on. Even if there are things that are not directly monetary, if they relate to the job, write them down. If they tell you "we're working on porting the front-end to Angular," write that down. If they say they have 20 employees, write that down. You want as much information as you can. You'll forget a lot of this stuff, and it's going to be important in informing your final decision.

###### Always keep the door open

Never give up your negotiating power until you're absolutely ready to make an informed, deliberate final decision. This means your job is to traverse as many of these decision points as possible without giving up the power to continue negotiating. Very frequently, your interlocutor will try to trick you into making a decision, or tie you to a decision you didn't commit to. You must keep verbally jiu-jitsu-ing out of these antics until you're actually ready to make your final decision.

###### Information is power

To protect your power in the negotiation, you must protect information as much as possible. A corollary of this rule is that you should not reveal to companies what you're currently making. So given this offer, don't ask for more money or equity or anything of the sort. Don't comment on any specific details of the offer except to clarify them. Companies will ask about your current compensation at different stages in the process—some before they ever interview you, some after they decide to make you an offer. But be mindful of this, and protect information.

> "Yeah, [COMPANY_NAME] sounds great! I really thought this was a good fit, and I'm glad that you guys agree. Right now I'm talking with a few other companies so I can't speak to the specific details of the offer until I'm done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I'm sure we'll be able to find a package that we're both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team."

###### Always be positive

Even if the offer is bad, it's extremely important to remain positive and excited about the company. This is because your excitement is one of your most valuable assets in a negotiation.

Despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1) you still like the company, and that 2) you're still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out. Generally the most convincing thing to signal this is to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they're working on, and really want to see things work out.

###### Don't be the decision maker

Even if you don't particularly care what your friends/family/husband/mother thinks, by mentioning them, you're no longer the only person the recruiter needs to win over. There's no point in them trying to bully and intimidate you; the "true decision-maker" is beyond their reach. This is a classic technique in customer support and remediation. It's never the person on the phone's fault, they're just some poor schmuck doing their job. It's not their decision to make. This helps to defuse tension and give them more control of the situation.

> I'll look over some of these details and discuss it with my [FAMILY/CLOSE_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT_OTHER]. I'll reach out to you if I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I'll be in touch!

It's much harder to pressure someone if they're not the final decision-maker. So take advantage of that.

###### Have alternatives

If you're already in the pipeline with other companies (which you should be if you're doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let them know that you've just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency. Regardless of whether you know the expiration date, all offers expire at some point, so take advantage of that.

> Hello [PERSON],
>
> I just wanted to update you on my own process. I've just received an offer from [COMPANY] which is quite strong. That said, I'm really excited about [YOUR AMAZING COMPANY] and really want to see if we can make it work. Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to expedite the process?

Should you specifically mention the company that gave you an offer? Depends. If it's a well-known company or a competitor, then definitely mention it. If it's a no-name or unsexy company, you should just say you received an offer. If it's expiring soon, you should mention that as well.

Either way, send out a letter like this to every single company you're talking to. No matter how hopeless or pointless you think your application is, you want to send this signal to everyone who is considering you in the market.

Companies care that you've received other offers. They care because each company knows that their own process is noisy, and the processes of most other companies are also noisy. But a candidate having multiple offers means that they have multiple weak signals in their favor. Combined, these converge into a much stronger signal than any single interview. It's like knowing that a student has a strong SAT score, and GPA, and won various scholarships. Sure, it's still possible that they're a dunce, but it's much harder for that to be true.

This is not to say that companies respond proportionally to these signals, or that they don't overvalue credentials and brands. They do. But caring about whether you have other offers and valuing you accordingly is completely rational.

Tell other companies that you've received offers. Give them more signals so that they know you're a valued and compelling candidate. And understand why this changes their mind about whether to interview you.

Your goal should be to have as many offers overlapping at the same time as possible. This will maximize your window for negotiating.

Have a strong BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) and communicate it.

> I 've received another offer from [OTHER CORP] that's very compelling on salary, but I really love the mission of [YOUR COMPANY] and think that it would overall be a better fit for me.

> I'm also considering going back to grad school and getting a Master's degree in Postmodern Haberdashery. I'm excited about [YOUR COMPANY] though and would love to join the team, but the package has to make sense if I'm going to forego a life of ironic hatmaking.

###### Proclaim reasons for everything

It's kind of a brain-hack, both for yourself and for your negotiating partner. Just stating a reason (any reason) makes your request feel human and important. It's not you being greedy, it's you trying to fulfill your goals.

The more unobjectionable and sympathetic your reason, the better. If it's medical expenses, or paying off student loans, or taking care of family, you'll bring tears to their eyes.

Just go with it, state a reason for everything, and you'll find recruiters more willing to become your advocate.

###### Be motivated by more than just money

You should be motivated by money too of course, but it should be one among many dimensions you're optimizing for. How much training you get, what your first project will be, which team you join, or even who your mentor will be—these are all things you can and should negotiate.

Of course, to negotiate well you need to understand the other side's preferences. You want to make the deal better for both of you.

###### Understand what they value

Remember that you can always get salary raises as you continue to work at the company, but there's only one point at which you can get a signing bonus.

The easiest thing for a company to give though is stock (if the company offers stock). Companies like giving stock because it invests you in the company and aligns interests. It also shifts some of the risk from the company over to you and burns less cash.

###### Be winnable

This is more than just giving the company the impression that you like them (which you continually should). But more so that you must give any company you're talking to a clear path on how to win you. Don't bullshit them or play stupid games. Be clear and unequivocal with your preferences and timeline.

Don't waste their time or play games for your own purposes. Even if the company isn't your dream company, you must be able to imagine at least some package they could offer you that would make you sign. If not, politely turn them down.

title: Understanding Compensation
---

Compensation is a huge factor when it comes to deciding between job offers. This section gives you a breakdown of the common components of compensation in the tech industry.

In most companies, your compensation will consist of base salary, a performance bonus and equity/stocks. For compensation data, check out [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/comp.html).

###### Base salary

Base salary is a fixed amount of salary you get for showing up at work and is unaffected by how well the company is performing or the industry is doing. It is the only non-variable component of your compensation.

Fresh graduates in the Bay Area can usually expect to get a base salary of above USD 100,000 (before taxes). The salary for fresh graduates at Facebook/Google is known to be in the USD 100,000 - 150,000 range.

Startups usually offer a bit higher for fresh graduate (USD 120,000 - 130,000) to make up for the lack of liquidity of the equity grant (not yet real cash).

Base salary doesn't increase linearly as you become more senior; it will plateau off eventually. As employees become increasingly senior within the company, the higher the proportion of their compensation comes from company-dependent factors such as bonus and equity. This is because senior employees are expected to influence the people around them and drive the company forward. A senior employee's performance will be based on how well the company does as a whole; the individual factor will not be as much.

There are some exceptions to the system. Companies like Netflix pay top in the industry (sometimes even more than Facebook/Google) and give employees the option to receive their entire compensation as base salary, that is, to convert the equity component into their base. For the risk-adverse, this is a great choice.

###### Bonus

Bonuses are usually paid on a semi-annual basis and are typically dependent on a few factors - level of seniority, individual performance in that time period, company performance in that time period.

- **Level of seniority** - This is usually a multiplier of the base salary, and the multiplier increases as the employee moves up the ranks
- **Individual performance** - This is a multiplier of how well an employee performed in that time period. E.g. meeting expectations results in a 100% multiplier and exceeding expectations results in a >100% multiplier. Companies like Facebook and Apple reward their top performers handsomely, and the multiplier can go up to 300% for the extremely high-performing employees
- **Company performance** - How well the company is doing. This multiplier will be the same for all employees

#### Examples

- Brandon is a Software Engineer fresh out of college. His base salary is 100,000, is a fresh grad (seniority multiplier: 10%), crushed expectations for the half (individual performance multiplier: 200%) and his company did pretty well (company performance multiplier: 120%). For that half, his bonus will be as follows:

  - **Bonus:** 100,000 x 50% (half a year) x 10% (seniority) x 200% (individual performance) x 120% (company performance) = 12000

- Alyssa is an Engineering Manager with 10 years of professional experience. Her base salary is 220,000, is an experienced engineering manager (seniority multiplier: 20%), exceeded expectations for the half (individual performance multiplier: 150%) and her company did pretty awesome (company performance multiplier: 130%). For that half, her bonus will be as follows:

  - **Bonus:** 200,000 x 50% (half a year) x 20% (seniority) x 200% (individual performance) x 130% (company performance) = 39000

Hence the amount of bonus you receive can be highly variable and senior employees get a higher proportion of their compensation from bonuses.

###### Equity/Stocks

Equity is what differentiates a tech job from a non-tech one. Equity means a share of the company; this signifies ownership and motivates employees to work in the best interests of the company. They can be a significant portion of one's compensation, sometimes even more than the base salary, especially for senior employees.

Equity usually vests (becomes available to you) over a period of time (typically 4 years) and can vest equally every month/quarter/year. A vesting cliff means the minimum period of time before your vesting begins. For example, if you are granted 4,800 shares over a 4 year schedule with a 1 year cliff, and monthly vesting, you will get 1,200 shares at the end of your first year and 100 shares every month thereafter for the subsequent 3 years.

Until the company goes public or gets acquired, the equity is not worth anything. Be mindful of what you are getting yourself into!

Not all equity is treated equally. Depending on the company you join and which stage that company is at, you may receive one of the following types: stock options or stock frants.

#### Stock options

Stock options are typically given by mid-stage companies. Stock options are different from stocks, which represents the immediate ownership of a company! Stock options are the **option/right** to purchase stocks at a given strike price, hence it's not free. However, the cost of each stock is usually quite low and fixed at a strike price, which is equal to the fair market value of the stock when it was granted to you. You are guaranteed to be able to purchase the stock at that price regardless of future increases.

When you leave a company, there is an exercise window (deadline given for you to exercise your options before they are gone), so it is important to have enough liquid cash to purchase them when planning a departure.

#### Stock grants

A stock grant is commonly referred to as a Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) and it means you possess the stock immediately. If the company is public, you can sell them during defined trading windows.

###### Signing bonus

This is a one-time lump sum that is paid to you when you join a company. This amount is typically in the range of USD 10,000 to USD 20,000 but can even go up to USD 50,000 (Google) and USD 100,000 (Facebook).

There can be conditions attached to signing bonuses, such as having to return a pro-rated amount if an employee leaves before the one-year mark. Make sure you are aware of them before you sign the offer.

###### Misc bonuses/perks

While these perks are not exactly cash, they can help you save money which is almost equivalent to getting compensated more.

- Free meals - Food is not exactly cheap in the Bay Area and having some meals provided on weekdays can result in saving few thousand dollars a year
- Relocation bonus - Helpful if you are moving from abroad, and this can partially offset costs due to relocating
- Shuttle service - Public transportation in the Bay Area is not that great and the most common form of commute is driving. Being able to take a shuttle service helps in saving money on gas, transport, and freeing up your mind to do other things during the commute
