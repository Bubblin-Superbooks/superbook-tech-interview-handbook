<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Strings Are Sequences</h4><p class="  start-chapter">A string is a sequence of characters. Many tips that apply to arrays also apply to strings.</p><p>Are there duplicate characters in the string, would it affect the answer?</p><p>When using an index to iterate through characters, be careful not to go out of bounds.</p><p>Be mindful about slicing or concatenating strings in your code. Typically, slicing and concatenating strings require O(n time. Use start and end indices to demarcate a substring where possible.)</p><p>Sometimes you can traverse the string from the right rather than from the left.</p></div> </div>
