By simple, we mean that the regex can only contain the following special characters: * (star), . (dot), + (plus). The star means that there will be zero or more of the previous character in that place in the pattern. The dot means any character for that position. The plus means one or more of previous character in that place in the pattern.</li></ul></div> </div>
