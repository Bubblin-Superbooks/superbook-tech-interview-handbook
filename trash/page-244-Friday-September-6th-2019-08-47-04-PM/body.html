It is the result of re-arranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, while using all the original letters only once.

This takes O(nlgn time and O(lgn) space.)</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">If we map each character to a prime number and we multiply each mapped number together, anagrams</li></ul></div> </div>
