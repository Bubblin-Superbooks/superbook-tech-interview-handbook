Design a function hasCheated(String s1, String s2, int N) that evaluates to true if two strings have a common substring of length N.

Follow up: Assume you don't have the possibility of using String.contains() and String.substring(). How would you implement this?</li><li>Follow up: Assume you don't have the possibility of using String.contains() and String.substring().
