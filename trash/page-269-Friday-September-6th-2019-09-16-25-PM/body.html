Tries have many practical applications, such as conducting searches and providing autocomplete. It is helpful to know these common applications so that you can easily identify when a problem can be efficiently solved using a trie.)</p><p>Sometimes preprocessing a dictionary of words (given in a list into a trie, will improve the efficiency of searching for a word of length k, among n words. Searching becomes O(k) instead of O(n).)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Be familiar with implementing, from scratch, a <code>Trie</code></p></div> </div>
