<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><ul><li>Find all words from a dictionary that are x edit distance away.</li><li>Given a string IP and number n, print all CIDR addresses that cover that range.</li><li>Write a function called eval, which takes a string and returns a boolean. This string is allowed 6 different characters: 0, 1, &, |, (, and ). eval should evaluate the string as a boolean expression, where 0 is false, 1 is true, & is an and, and | is an or.

E.g "(0 | (1 | 0) & (1 & ((1 | 0) & 0))")</li><li>E.g "(0 | (1 | 0) & (1 & ((1 | 0) & 0))")</li><li>Given a pattern string like "abba" and an input string like "redbluebluered", return true if and only if there's a one to one mapping of letters in the pattern to substrings of the input.

E.g. "abba" and "redbluebluered" should return true.
E.g. "aaaa" and "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
E.g. "aabb" and "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false.</li></ul></div> </div>
