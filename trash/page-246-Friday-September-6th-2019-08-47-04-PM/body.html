<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Palindrome</h3><p class="  start-chapter">A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as <em>madam</em> or <em>racecar</em>.</p><p>Here are ways to determine if a string is a palindrome:</p><ul><li>Reverse the string and it should be equal to itself.</li><li>Have two pointers at the start and end of the string. Move the pointers inward till they meet. At any point in time, the characters at both pointers should match.</li></ul><p>The order of characters within the string matters, so HashMaps are usually not helpful.</p></div> </div>
